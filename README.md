Netflix Dataset Analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

The Netflix dataset was analyzed using Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. The objective was to explore the dataset and extract meaningful insights regarding Netflix’s content trends, production patterns, and viewer preferences.

The analysis began with data cleaning, including handling missing values and converting date columns to appropriate formats. Using Pandas, we explored the structure of the dataset and performed grouping and filtering operations to understand various aspects like the type of content (Movies vs. TV Shows), content added over the years, and distribution across countries.

Seaborn and Matplotlib were used to create visualizations that revealed several key insights. For instance, it was observed that the number of TV shows has increased significantly in recent years, indicating Netflix’s shift towards serialized content. The United States emerged as the leading producer of content, while countries like India, the UK, and Canada also contributed substantially. Analysis of release years showed a peak in content addition around 2018-2020.

Genre-based analysis highlighted that dramas and comedies are the most common genres, reflecting user demand. The duration of movies and number of seasons for TV shows were also analyzed to identify patterns in content length.

Overall, this project demonstrated how exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python tools can help uncover business-relevant insights. It provided a deeper understanding of Netflix’s content strategy and trends, showcasing the importance of data in driving content decisions.
